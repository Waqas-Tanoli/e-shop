*** Step no 1 ***
I created workspace with nx for monorepo architecture.

*** Step no 2 ***
I installed express in workspace and named it as api-gateway

*** Step no 3 ***
Then I did this in package.json so i can run all the available services

 "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx nx run-many --target=serve --all"
  },

  *** Step no 4 ***
  after this i installed express-http-proxy , this is an express middleware to proxy request to another host and pass back response to the original caller. 
  // matlab k ham jo b service bana rahy hen like api-gateway , auth-serice etc wo sab ak port laiti hen like 6000,6001... , so in sab ports ko ikatha kr k aik e jagha run krny k liy express-http-proxy ko use kren gy


What is Morgan?
Answer: morgan is a logging middleware for Node.js/Express apps, primarily used to log HTTP requests. morgan logs details about incoming HTTP requests in your Express app (like method, URL, status, response time, etc.)

If we get an error port already use , then we can run this command in terminal to kill that port and fix the error

npx kill-port 6060 or any port which cause the error

*** Step no 5 ***
After this i created packages folder in root dir and in packages folder i created error-handler folder -> error-middleware.ts and index.ts
index.ts contains all error logics, classes etc and i define classses for erros , common errors etc.
